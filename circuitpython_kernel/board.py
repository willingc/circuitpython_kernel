    If you do not see the REPL hit `enter` a few times. Control-A or Home
    sends you to beginning of line. Control-E or End to the end of the line.

    SAMD21 REPL prompt is `>>>`
       - Press any key will enter REPL
       - Ctrl-D does a soft reset.

    ESP8266 REPL prompt is `>>>`

    There are four other control commands:

    Ctrl-A on a blank line will enter raw REPL mode. This is like a permanent
    paste mode, except that characters are not echoed back.

    Ctrl-B on a blank like goes to normal REPL mode.

    Ctrl-C cancels any input, or interrupts the currently running code.

    Ctrl-D on a blank line will do a soft reset.

    Note that Ctrl-A and Ctrl-D do not work with WebREPL.
